    "In this lab, we practiced using `while` loops, which continue executing their block of code until the given condition is no longer true. This is useful for instances where we do not have a collection or do not need a collection to solve our problem, especially when we would only like to stop the process according to a certain condition. We then practiced using control flow statements, `break` and `continue`, to selectively operate on elements, append them to new lists, or assign them to new variables."
